# Model Context Protocol specification

This repo contains the specification and protocol schema for the Model Context Protocol.

The schema is [defined in TypeScript](schema/2025-03-26/schema.ts) first, but
[made available as JSON Schema](schema/2025-03-26/schema.json) as well, for wider
compatibility.

The official MCP documentation is built using Mintlify and available at
[modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).
