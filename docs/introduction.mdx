<Note>C# SDK released! Check out [what else is new.](/development/updates)</Note>

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## Why MCP?

MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:
- A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
- The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
- Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure

### General architecture

At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Your Computer"
        Host["Host with MCP Client\n(Claude, IDEs, Tools)"]
        S1["MCP Server A"]
        S2["MCP Server B"]
        S3["MCP Server C"]
        Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S1
        Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S2
        Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S3
        S1 <--> D1[("Local\nData Source A")]
        S2 <--> D2[("Local\nData Source B")]
    end
    subgraph "Internet"
        S3 <-->|"Web APIs"| D3[("Remote\nService C")]
    end
```

- **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
- **Local Data Sources**: Your computer's files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
- **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to
