<Info>**Protocol Revision**: draft</Info>

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The Model Context Protocol provides authorization capabilities at the transport level,
enabling MCP clients to make requests to restricted MCP servers on behalf of resource
owners. This specification defines the authorization flow for HTTP-based transports.

### 1.2 Protocol Requirements

Authorization is **OPTIONAL** for MCP implementations. When supported:

- Implementations using an HTTP-based transport **SHOULD** conform to this specification.
- Implementations using an STDIO transport **SHOULD NOT** follow this specification, and
  instead retrieve credentials from the environment.
- Implementations using alternative transports **MUST** follow established security best
  practices for their protocol.

### 1.3 Standards Compliance

This authorization mechanism is based on established specifications listed below, but
implements a selected subset of their features to ensure security and interoperability
while maintaining simplicity:

- OAuth 2.1 IETF DRAFT ([draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12))
- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata
  ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414))
- OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol
  ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591))
- OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728))

## 2. Authorization Flow

### 2.1 Overview

1. MCP authorization servers **MUST** implement OAuth 2.1 with appropriate security
   measures for both confidential and public clients.

1. MCP authorization servers and MCP clients **SHOULD** support the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration
   Protocol ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)).

1. MCP servers **MUST** implement OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)).
   MCP clients **MUST** use OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata for authorization server discovery.

1. MCP authorization servers and MCP clients **MUST** implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization
   Server Metadata ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414)).

### 2.1.1 OAuth Grant Types

OAuth specifies different flows or grant types, which are different ways of obtaining an
access token. Each of these targets different use cases and scenarios.

MCP servers **SHOULD** support the OAuth grant types that best align with the intended
audience. For instance:

1. Authorization Code: useful when the client is acting on behalf of a (human) end user.
   - For instance, an agent calls an MCP tool implemented by a SaaS system.
2. Client Credentials: the client is another application (not a human)
   - For instance, an agent calls a secure MCP tool to check inventory at a specific
     store. No need to impersonate the end user.

### 2.2 Roles
A protected MCP server acts as a [OAuth 2.1 resource server](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12.html#name-roles),
capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

An MCP client acts as an [OAuth 2.1 client](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12.html#name-roles),
making protected resource requests on behalf of a resource owner.

The authorization server is responsible for interacting with the user and issuing access tokens for use at the MCP server. The implementation details of the authorization server are beyond the scope of this specification. It may be the same server as the
resource server or a separate entity. Section [2.3 Authorization Server Discovery](#2-3-authorizaton-server-discovery)
specifies how an MCP server indicates the location of its corresponding authorization server to a client.

### 2.3 Authorization Server Discovery
This section describes the mechanisms by which MCP servers advertise their associated
authorization servers to MCP clients, as well as the discovery process through which MCP
clients can determine authorization server endpoints and supported capabilities.

### 2.3.1 Authorization Server Location

MCP servers **MUST** implement OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728))
specification to indicate the locations of authorization servers. The Protected Resource Metadata document returned by the MCP server **MUST** include
the `authorization_servers` field containing at least one authorization server.

The specific use of `authorization_servers` is beyond the scope of this specification; implementers should consult
OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)) for
guidance on implementation details.

Implementors should note that Protected Resource Metadata documents can define multiple authorization servers. The responsibility for selecting which authorization server to use lies with the MCP client, following the guidelines specified in
[RFC9728 Section 7.6 "Authorization Servers"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#name-authorization-servers).

MCP servers **MUST** use the HTTP header `WWW-Authenticate` when returning a _401 Unauthorized_ to indicate the location of the resource server metadata URL
as described in OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)).

MCP clients **MUST** be able to parse `WWW-Authenticate` headers and respond appropriately to `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses from the MCP server.

#### 2.3.2 Server Metadata Discovery

MCP clients **MUST** follow the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata protocol defined
in [RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414) to obtain the information
required to interact with the authorization server.

#### 2.3.4 Sequence Diagram
The following diagram outlines an example flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant M as MCP Server (Resource Server)
    participant A as Authorization Server

    C->>M: MCP request without token
    M-->>C: HTTP 401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header
    Note over C: Extract resource_metadata<br />from WWW-Authenticate

    C->>M: GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
    M-->>C: Resource metadata with authorization server URL
    Note over C: Validate RS metadata,<br />build AS metadata URL

    C->>A: GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
    A-->>C: Authorization server metadata

    Note over C,A: OAuth 2.1 authorization flow happens here

    C->>A: Token request
    A-->>C: Access token

    C->>M: MCP request with access token
    M-->>C: MCP response
    Note over C,M: MCP communication continues with valid token
```

#### 2.4 MCP specific headers for discovery

MCP clients **SHOULD** include the `MCP-Protocol-Version: <protocol-version>` HTTP header during
any request to the MCP server allowing the MCP server to respond based on the MCP protocol version.

MCP servers **SHOULD** use the `MCP-Protocol-Version` header to determine compatibility with the MCP client.

For example: `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2024-11-05`

### 2.5 Dynamic Client Registration

MCP clients and authorization servers **SHOULD** support the
[OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)
to allow MCP clients to obtain OAuth client IDs without user interaction. This provides a
standardized way for clients to automatically register with new authorization servers, which is crucial
for MCP because:

- Clients may not know all possible MCP servers and their authorization servers in advance.
- Manual registration would create friction for users.
- It enables seamless connection to new MCP servers and their authorization servers.
- Authorization servers can implement their own registration policies.

Any MCP authorization servers that _do not_ support Dynamic Client Registration need to provide
alternative ways to obtain a client ID (and, if applicable, client credentials). For one of
these authorization servers, MCP clients will have to either:

1. Hardcode a client ID (and, if applicable, client credentials) specifically for that MCP
   server, or
2. Present a UI to users that allows them to enter these details, after registering an
   OAuth client themselves (e.g., through a configuration interface hosted by the
   server).

### 2.6 Authorization Flow Steps

The complete Authorization flow proceeds as follows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as User-Agent (Browser)
    participant C as Client
    participant M as MCP Server (Resource Server)
    participant A as Authorization Server

    C->>M: MCP request without token
    M->>C: HTTP 401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header
    Note over C: Extract resource_metadata URL from WWW-Authenticate

    C->>A: GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
    A->>C: Authorization server metadata response

    alt Dynamic client registration
        C->>A: POST /register
        A->>C: Client Credentials
    end

    Note over C: Generate PKCE parameters
    C->>B: Open browser with authorization URL + code_challenge
    B->>A: Authorization request
    Note over A: User authorizes
    A->>B: Redirect to callback with authorization code
    B->>C: Authorization code callback
    C->>A: Token request + code_verifier
    A->>C: Access token (+ refresh token)
    C->>M: MCP request with access token
    M-->>C: MCP response
```

### 2.7 Access Token Usage

#### 2.7.1 Token Requirements

Access token handling **MUST** conform to
[OAuth 2.1 Section 5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-5)
requirements for resource requests. Specifically:

1. MCP client **MUST** use the Authorization request header field
   [Section 5.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-5.1.1):

```
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
```

Note that authorization **MUST** be included in every HTTP request from client to server,
even if they are part of the same logical session.

2. Access tokens **MUST NOT** be included in the URI query string

Example request:

```http
GET /v1/contexts HTTP/1.1
Host: mcp.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

#### 2.7.2 Token Handling

Resource servers **MUST** validate access tokens as described in
[Section 5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-5.2).
If validation fails, servers **MUST** respond according to
[Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-5.3)
error handling requirements. Invalid or expired tokens **MUST** receive a HTTP 401
response.

MCP clients **MUST NOT** send tokens to the MCP server other than ones issued by the MCP server's authorization server.

MCP authorization servers **MUST** only accept tokens that are valid for use with their
own resources.

MCP servers **MUST NOT** accept or transit any other tokens.


### 2.8 Error Handling

Servers **MUST** return appropriate HTTP status codes for authorization errors:

| Status Code | Description  | Usage                                      |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 401         | Unauthorized | Authorization required or token invalid    |
| 403         | Forbidden    | Invalid scopes or insufficient permissions |
| 400         | Bad Request  | Malformed authorization request            |

## 3. Security Considerations

Implementations **MUST** follow OAuth 2.1 security best practices as laid out in [Section 7. Security Considerations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#name-security-considerations).

### 3.1 Token Theft
Attackers who obtain tokens stored by the client, or tokens cached or logged on the server can access protected resources with
requests that appear legitimate to resource servers.

Clients **MUST** implement secure token storage and follow OAuth best practices,
as outlined in [OAuth 2.1, section 7.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-7.1).

MCP authorization servers SHOULD issue short-lived access tokens token to reduce the impact of leaked tokens. For public clients, MCP authorization servers MUST rotate refresh tokens as described in [Section 4.3.1 of OAuth 2.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-4.3.1).

### 3.2 Communication Security
Implementations MUST follow [OAuth 2.1 section 1.5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-1.5).

Specifically:
1. All authorization server endpoints **MUST** be served over HTTPS.
1. All redirect URIs **MUST** be either `localhost` or use HTTPS.

### 3.3 Authorization Code Protection

An attacker who has gained access to an authorization code contained in an authorization response can try to redeem the authorization code for an access token or otherwise make use of the authorization code. (Further described in [OAuth 2.1, section 7.5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-7.5))

MCP clients **MUST** implement PKCE according to [OAuth 2.1 section 7.5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-7.5.2). PKCE helps prevent authorization code interception and injection attacks by requiring clients to create a secret verifier-challenge pair, ensuring that only the original requestor can exchange an authorization code for tokens.


### 3.3 Open Redirection
An attacker may craft malicious redirect URIs to direct users to phishing sites.

MCP clients **MUST** have redirect URIs registered with the authorization server.

Authorization servers **MUST** validate exact redirect URIs against pre-registered values to prevent redirection attacks.

MCP clients **SHOULD** use and verify state parameters in the authorization code flow
and discard any results that do not include or have a mis-match with the original state.

Authorization servers **MUST** take precautions to prevent redirecting user agents to untrusted URI's, following suggestions laid out in [OAuth 2.1, Section 7.12.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-7.12.2)

Authorization servers **SHOULD** only automatically redirect the user agent if it trusts the redirection URI. If the URI is not trusted, the authorization server MAY inform the user and rely on the user to make the correct decision.

### 3.4 Confused Deputy Problem

Attackers can exploit MCP servers acting as intermediaries to third-party APIs, leading to confused deputy vulnerabilities. By using stolen authorization codes, they can obtain access tokens without user consent. See [Security Best Practices 2.1](/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices) for details.

MCP proxy servers using static client IDs **MUST** obtain user consent for each dynamically
registered client before forwarding to third-party authorization servers (which may require additional consent).
