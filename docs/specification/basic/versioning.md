The Model Context Protocol uses string-based version identifiers following the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, to indicate the last date backwards incompatible changes were made.

The current protocol version is **{{< param protocolRevision >}}**. [See all revisions]({{< ref "/specification/revisions" >}}).

{{< callout type="info" >}}
  The protocol version will _not_ be incremented when the protocol is updated, as long as the changes maintain backwards compatibility. This allows for incremental improvements while preserving interoperability.
{{< /callout >}}

Version negotiation happens during [initialization]({{< ref "/specification/basic/lifecycle#initialization" >}}). Clients and servers **MAY** support multiple protocol versions simultaneously, but they **MUST** agree on a single version to use for the session.

The protocol provides appropriate error handling if version negotiation fails, allowing clients to gracefully terminate connections when they cannot find a version compatible with the server.
